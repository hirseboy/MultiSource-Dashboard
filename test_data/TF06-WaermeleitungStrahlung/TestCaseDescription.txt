For the calculation of heat flows between indoor and outdoor air, the correct representation of the air exchange in the thermal building simulation is required. The test case described below tests the functionality of a model or the model implementation/software with regard to the determination of the air exchange between indoor and outdoor air and the resulting energy flows. A design structure with an insulation layer that is the same on all sides is selected. The thermal insulation property of the insulation layer effectively limits the change in indoor temperature due to heat conduction through the structure. Thus, the air exchange becomes the decisive mechanism of the indoor air temperature adjustment to the outdoor air. Several test variants are considered, each of which differs in the air exchange rate to be applied.
