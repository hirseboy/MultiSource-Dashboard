For the calculation of heat transport processes in thermal building simulation, the correct representation of dynamic heat conduction and storage depending on given climatic boundary conditions (outdoor climate) is necessary. The test case described below checks this functionality of a model or the model implementation/software. In addition, the correct heat transmission between two neighboring zones is considered (multi-zone simulation).
