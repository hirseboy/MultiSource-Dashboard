# SimQuality-Dashboard Scripts

This repository conatins all the data of the simquality dashboard (https://simquality.herokuapp.com) (https://simquality.de/simquality-test-suite/).

The dashboard itself is based on python and the libraries _Plotly_ (https://plotly.com/) and _Dash_ (https://dash.plotly.com/) and is conceptualized to show
all the relevant simulated test case data that has been generated by the _SimQuality_ reserach projekt (https://simquality.de).

All the evaluation and consistency checks are done by the SimQuality Evaluation Script (https://github.com/ghorwin/SimQuality)

## Data ## 

All data in directory _dash_data_ is directly shown in Dashboard.

### Diagram data ###

All the data needed to be shown in the plotly diagrams are within the sub-directory of the test case e.g. "TF01-Sonnenstand". Inside this a sub-directory for each variable with the variable name exists. 

```
TF01-Sonnenstand
|- Potsdam Altitude
    |- TRNSYS.ftr
    |- NANDRAD.ftr
    |- ...
|- Potsdam Azimuth
|- ...
TF02-SolareLasten Isotrop
...
Results.tsv
```

Inside the sub-directories all data for a specific tool e.g. TRNSYS is saved in the feather-format (https://pypi.org/project/feather-format/) with the tool Id as its name e.g. "TRNSYS.ftr".

### Evaluation data ###

All evaluation data is stored inside the _results.tsv_ file for all test cases and tools. The script is only reading the TSV file at the initialization of the website and afterwards just filters the specific data.

```

## FAQ ##

**How to run the Dashboard on my local machine?**

All needed libs to run the Dashboard on a local machine are registered inside the _requirements.txt_ and can be installed via pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/) using the following command (start console inside the project directory):

`pip install to-requirements.txt`
