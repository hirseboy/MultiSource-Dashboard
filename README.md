# SimQuality-Dashboard Scripts

This repository conatins all the data of the simquality dashboard (https://simquality.herokuapp.com) (https://simquality.de/simquality-test-suite/).

The dashboard itself is based on python and the libraries _Plotly_ (https://plotly.com/) and Dash (https://dash.plotly.com/) and is conceptualized to show
all the relevant simulated test case data that has been generated by the _SimQuality_ reserach projekt (https://simquality.de).

All the evaluation and consistency checks are done by the SimQuality Evaluation Script (https://github.com/ghorwin/SimQuality)

All data in directory _dash_data_ is directly shown in Dashboard.
