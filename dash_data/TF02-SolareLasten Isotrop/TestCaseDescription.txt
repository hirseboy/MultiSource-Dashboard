The test case described below is taken from DIN EN ISO 13791 "Thermal performance of buildings". In this test case, a test room is subjected to a climatic jump in the outside air temperature from 20 °C to 30 °C within one hour. There are a total of 4 test variants in which the layer structure and the material properties of the enclosing structure are changed. In each test variant, all 6 enclosure constructions are of identical design and have the same boundary conditions.
